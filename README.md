# **Problem Faced**

           1) I got issue related to window going blank some times. 
           
              The issue was with latest version of opencv-python(4.3.0.36)
              
              You can find version of opencv-python using command
              
              #cv2.__version__
              
              Shift to stable older release if you find same issue i moved to version (4.2.0.34) using command
              
              #pip3 install opencv-python==4.2.0.34
